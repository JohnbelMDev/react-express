# useEffect

We use the `useEffect` for calling functions with side effects within our components. 

`useEffect(callbackFunction, optionalDependencyArray)` *useEffect returns nothing!*

`useEffect` takes in a callback function as its first argument.  
When the function component renders (or re-renders), the callback function that is passed to `useEffect` will run.  
`useEffect` can also take in an optional second argument: an array. The values in this array act as a list of dependencies. 

Let's take a look at an example use case. Here, we are using `useEffect` to trigger an alert (pop-up window) if `count` is divisible by 5.  
`useEffect` is activated every time the `count` state changes because `count` is listed as a dependency.

<Example code={useEffectWithDeps}/>

## Undefined or Empty Dependency Array

If a dependency array is not given (undefined) or is an empty array, `useEffect` will have a different behavior. 

`useEffect` will trigger... 

- if a value changes in the given dependency array
- only once when the component first renders if there is an empty dependency array `[]`
- on any and every state change or render of the component if there is no dependency array (it is undefined)

Here is an example of the second bullet point, where the dependency array is an empty array. 
`useEffect` will activate only once. 

<Example code={useEffectWithEmptyDeps}/>

Here is an example of the third bullet point, where the dependency array is undefined. 
`useEffect` will trigger every time any state is changed in the component.
