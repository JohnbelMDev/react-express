# Elements

We instantiate React elements using the `React.createElement` API. Typically, we call this API using JSX elements, but it's also possible to call it directly.

The function signature is: `createElement(type, props, children)`.

## Element tree

Let's take a quick peek at the internals of a React element tree. The exact details of the element tree aren't important to understand right now, but it's useful to get the _gist_ of how React works.

In this example, we instantiate a few React components using JSX and then print their value to the console.

> If you click the line of text in the console on the right, you can navigate the tree of JavaScript objects.

<Example
  code={reactElements}
  console={{
    enabled: true,
    visible: true,
    maximized: true,
    collapsible: false,
  }}
  playground={{ enabled: false }}
  styles={{
    playerPane: {
      width: '50%',
      marginLeft: '0',
    },
  }}
  responsivePaneSets={[
    {
      maxWidth: 920,
      panes: [
        {
          type: 'stack',
          children: [
            { type: 'editor', title: 'Code' },
            {
              type: 'player',
              title: 'Console Output',
              style: { width: '100%', height: '100%' },
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

A React element is _essentially_ a JavaScript object containing a `type` and `props` object.

The `props` object may contain arbitrary properties, e.g. `foo`, plus a `children` property containing nested React elements. The `children` property is somewhat special, since it's created automatically from the nested JSX elements in our code.

## Up next

Now that we know how React elements work, we can try rendering them to the DOM using React DOM.
